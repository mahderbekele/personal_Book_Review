                    <h2>FAMILY</h2>
                    <p id="family_text">In the book, Beneath the Lion's gaze, family is a key issue portrayed in the
                        book.<br> The book
                        is
                        mainly set up in Hailu’s householdwhereby he has two sons, Yonas<br> and Dawait. Yonas marries
                        Sara
                        and they get Tizita and Dawait is the troublesome kid.<br> Hailu loses his wife Selam, and there
                        is
                        a shift in the way life is for the family. Hailu’s<br> family faces different challenges such as
                        conflicts between Hailu and his troublesome <br> son Dawait. There is also conflict between
                        Dawait
                        and his brother Yonas.However, amidst <br>the conflict, there is a sense of protection whereby
                        Hailu
                        and Yonas were ready to protect<br> Dawait when the soldiers came looking for him. When Hailu is
                        taken to jail, Dawait goes <br>looking for him even if they are having conflicts. Also, Yonas
                        goes
                        round looking for Dawait <br>even in morgues even if they are conflicting.<br>
                        <br>
                        In our current society, conflict in families happens every now and then but love comes in<br>
                        between and allows people to solve the conflicts and bond together. Additionally, sibling<br>
                        fighting is also a common thing in the society today but then they are always willing to<br>
                        offer
                        protection to each other even if there are conflicts between them.

                    <h2>RELIGION </h2>
                    <p id="church">In Beneath the Lion's Gaze religion has been portrayed to play such a pivotal role in
                        the
                        community and society . Hailu and his family members are portrayed as very religious people
                        .This is evidently shown in numerous occasions throughout the book.
                        For instance Sara who is the wife of Yonas and mother to their daughter Tizita is seen as very
                        prayerful when Tizita falls sick . She fasts for days and even goes as far as crawling in church
                        while praying to God to save and spare her daughter from the cruel hands of death.She does the
                        crawling ritual so much that her knees are badly bruised all in the form of prayer believing
                        that ,that will aid in healing her daughter Tizita.<br>

                        In another case when Hailu gets arrested Yonas spends most of his time in their family prayer
                        room and is also seen reading the Bible .During the instances when he was faced with uncertainty
                        and problems he is seen to retreat to the prayer room.
                        This is something that is common from most of the family members which is why Hailu
                        even had a prayer room built inside the house during the earlier days.<br>

                        Religion still has a place in today’s society where it acts as a moral compass and ethical
                        framework. Religion often guides people morally, preventing them from making certain decisions
                        due to the fostering of ethics in humanity .
                        It also gives people a sense of meaning and purpose in their daily lives. Religious people tend
                        to feel like they belong to a certain community e.g like a church where they get support from .
                        This is clearly shown when before a religious person makes a life decision they will first have
                        to pass it by their various religious communities . In a society like Kenya people tend to
                        celebrate occasions generally after or while involving the church like how graduation ceremonies
                        are celebrated in churches as a form of thanksgiving.

                    <p id="power">
                        The book starts of at the regime of the Emperor Haile Silassie and tries to explain how the
                        emperor ruled the country to some extent, Then the book shows the shift from the royal rule to
                        violent control of the military power which was known as the derg, where power was in the hand
                        of those who held the gun which was under the general Gudu who was the face of the Derg.

                        It also talks about the university students which involved Dawit, who was the younger son of
                        Hailu, who was inspired by the revolutionary ideas and the hopes of justice after which they
                        discovered that the Derg wasn’t actually looking for justice but to take revenge, bring a chaos
                        and mass murdering to the people of the country to the point that the people were living in
                        constant fear of speaking up or even grieve the loss of their own family members.

                    <h2>BETRAYAL</h2>
                    <p id="power">It’s one of the main theme in the Beneath the Lion's Gaze which is among the family of
                        Hailu and Ethiopians state .For example,Hailu being a protagonist in the book he faces betrayal
                        from the assistance Amalz who was his nurse,she discloses that Hailu killed a girl using cyanide
                        injection although it was out of mercy to prevent the girl from suffering from the beating she
                        had received from the derg this lead him to be imprisoned.Dawit go against his family to join
                        the protesting army betraying his own family.
                        The resistance group that is the derg betrayed the people of Ethiopia by causing more conflict
                        and bloodshed in the state.
                        Colonel’s daughter is involved in distributing pamphlets which is illegal hence a form of
                        betraying the authority and traditions which was not allowed in the state.
                        Beneath the lion's Gaze is a metaphor which shows the oppressive gaze of the powerful,which
                        betrayed the people and left them in the sense of defensiveness.

                        <p> This book has a very deep and powerful story telling it makes the readers to be attached to
                            the characters and takes them to the the time and place imaginatively.
                            I personally loved the book and related to every single character, specifically the little
                            boy birhane who had to start working at a very young age because of his familiy’s economical
                            issues and how he ended up, the way the writer narrates about his appearance, what he was
                            wearing and how he had a very small figure ,it made me feel like I knew the child, and
                            honestly I learned about the history of the country that I didn’t even know of and that
                            child has stayed with me even a week after finishing the book.

                            Although it took me a while to form the attachment, I loved and enjoyed almost every single pages
                            of the book and I will definitely read it again. It was a beautiful story.

                        <p>Beneath the Lion's Gaze by Maaza Mengiste is a poignant, emotionally charged novel that
                            explores the turbulent years of the Ethiopian Revolution. Through the lives of a family
                            deeply affected by the political unrest, Mengiste paints a vivid picture of the human cost
                            of revolution—betrayal, loyalty, sacrifice, and violence. The narrative is rich with
                            historical detail, offering insight into a nation’s struggle for freedom, as well as the
                            personal, emotional battles fought within families. Mengiste’s exploration of power,
                            corruption, and trauma makes this a powerful and timeless reflection on the nature of
                            political conflict. With its compelling characters and beautifully crafted prose, this novel
                            not only illuminates Ethiopia's past but also resonates with current global struggles
                            against authoritarianism and violence.

                            African countries all have interesting histories and looking at "Beneath the lions gaze"
                            book, we learn a lot about the Ethiopian history. From culture, to politics, to family and
                            many other aspects on Ethiopia we learn as they are well captured in the book. More
                            interestingly is how Maaza the author is able to capture this is in narration and by the use
                            of Hailu's family. She explains on a major historical period of Ethiopia popularly known as
                            "The Derg". Under this period, Ethiopia is burdened with famine and political instability.
                            The story follows the journey of Hailus family and the various challenges they faced during
                            that period. Through various characters such as Dawit and Solomon revolution takes place.
                            Many people loose their lives for example Berhanu who is an innocent child. The fall of the
                            Derg is what transitions Ethiopia to freedom. The book is like a mirror to what other
                            countries have experienced before getting to their current period.

                        <p>Beneath the Lion’s Gaze by Maaza Mengiste is a gripping novel set during Ethiopia’s violent
                            revolution, following a family’s struggle to survive as the world around them crumbles.
                            Mengiste captures the deep personal cost of political conflict, especially through the
                            brutal fight between Dawit and Miki—once close friends, now enemies divided by loyalty and
                            betrayal. Their confrontation, filled with rage and heartbreak, symbolizes how revolution
                            shatters not just nations but also human bonds. With vivid prose and emotional depth,
                            Mengiste paints a haunting portrait of love, loss, and resistance.</p>

          <p> <b>Romantic love: </b> Trevor's first ever romantic crush(love) was a girl named Zaheera, whom <br> he
            found
            very beautiful, and as he described her, a silent, shy, and well-mannered girl, <br> whom he made a friend
            afraid of rejection, and with the thought of her being out of his <br> league. And he was thinking about
            working
            on it in the long run, thinking that he would <br> have more time to spend with her, which eventually wasn’t
            the
            case, and she left the <br> country to go abroad. And later on, he learns from her friends that she was
            interested in <br>him, which taught him a lesson about acting on time and to have courage.
            <br> <br>

            A lesson that Trevor highlights in the book that he learnt was that you do not own the <br> people you love
            .
            This lesson was brought about by his love for his dog Fufi.He <br> mentions how Fufi could do a bunch of
            things,
            like jumping over the perimeter wall <br>during the day and going out to some other kid's house. The day
            that
            he
            followed Fufi <br> and found this out, it hurt him so much that he felt like he was being cheated on . In
            his
            <br> head, he loved Fufi, which meant Fufi was his, but in a real sense, Fufi was just a dog <br> that he
            loved,
            and Fufi was allowed a life of his own. This story comes up as an <br> important lesson he learnt in life,
            which
            he later applied to his personal romantic life. He <br> learnt that you just have to love people, and the
            people
            you love have no obligation <br> toward you and can have a life of their own because they do not belong to
            you
            just <br> because you love them.
            <br> <br>
            <b>Familial love:</b> growing up with his mom, Trevor learnt the love that his mother had for <br> him and
            the
            sacrifices that she made to raise him well and to show him what he <br> deserves. There was this quote from
            the
            book which he used to describe that, which <br> was “Love is a creative act. When you love someone you
            create
            a
            new world for them. <br> My mother did that for me, and with the progress I made and the things I learned, I
            <br> came back and created a new world and a new understanding for her.”

        <h2>Feeling Like an Outsider</h2>
      </div>
      <div class="feelinglikeanoutsider">
        <div class="feelinglikeanoutsider_parag">
          <p>Trevor Noah, both as an individual and a celebrity, recounts a part of his school life <br> where he felt
            invisible. In his book, he reflects on his lack of popularity and the <br> absence of a defined clique,
            contrasting his experience with his peers, such as the <br> white students who gathered together or the
            black
            kids from the township who <br> played soccer together. As the only mixed-race student among a school
            population
            <br>of over a thousand, he often felt alone and out of place. As Trevor Noah states in his <br> book, “It is
            easier to be an insider as an outsider than to be an outsider as an insider”
            <br> <br>
            This experience resonates strongly in today's world and generation, particularly for <br> international
            students. For instance, being a Black African student in a study-abroad <br> program poses unique challenges
            that many may not fully understand. The <br> distinctions between you and other students become painfully
            apparent, and <br> sometimes, even fellow Black students may create a divide, perceiving a difference <br>
            between themselves as African Americans and you as an African student.
            <br> <br>
            To cope with these challenges, many African students tend to form supportive <br> groups among themselves.
            Additionally, seeking therapy sessions has become a <br> common strategy, helping them navigate the feelings
            of
            isolation often experienced <br> in a foreign environment.
            <br> <br>
            Another instance of feeling like an anomaly individually is being raised by <br> guardians . This came up
            from
            a
            discussion where an experience of being raised <br> in an extended family took away the opportunity for
            familiarity among the <br> household members. This led to the feeling of being the odd one out, where you
            <br>
            tend to feel like you are not recognized and you are not seen . In the context of <br> Trevoh Noah’s book, I
            highly resonate with his experiences where he felt like he <br> did not fit in and created his little world
            for
            himself. This was how he coped with <br> the fact that he was among people, yet alone ,this tends to happen
            frequently.

          <p>Patricia acts as the sole caregiver and protector to Trevor. Raising Trevor she is a strict <br>mother, but
            she
            is strict with him in order to impact positive values in Trevor. She <br> believes being strict with Trevor
            is
            what helps in shaping him into a better person <br> with values. These values that Trevor learns guide who
            he
            becomes a person and <br>instills discipline in him. Particia is also hard working and does what she can to
            <br>ensure that they are able to support themselves financially. This character inspires <br>Trevor and
            pushes
            him in his career. Trevor also comes out as hardworking and <br>does everything needed to achieve his goal.
            For
            example, in his CD and DJ job, <br>where he gets local fame, Trevor runs the business with hard work and
            passion. It <br> is through his actions that he is able to see his business develop and grow. <br>Patricia’s
            resilience also teaches Trevor to always stand on what is right. She goes <br>against various societal
            expectations and does what she thinks is right. <br> <br>

            When Trevor makes a mistake in school instead of reprimanding or punishing him, <br>Patricia weighs on the
            matter and uses it to impact meaningful lessons to Trevor. <br>There is a time that Trevor takes the
            communion
            which he is supposed not to take. <br>He gets reprimanded by the school. When Patricia gets to know of this,
            she
            <br>addresses the matter by thinking it is not right to deny a child that. Patricia did not <br>just follow
            the
            rules but instead questioned them and only abided by what was <br>right. Through all these, Trevor learns to
            always stand up for what is right. <br> <br>

            Additionally, raising Trevor as a mixed race child during the apartheid times is very <br>challenging to
            Patricia. This is most especially due to the fact that she is the sole <br>protector to Trevor and mixed
            people
            in the society were viewed differently.Despite <br>the struggles, she goes through all means to ensure that
            Trevor is raised well. She <br>does what she can to ensure that Trevor gets only what is best. It is through
            <br>Patricia that Trevor learns English as she gets him books to read and also teaches <br>him. This is also
            seen when she takes Trevor to a private school that is majorly for <br>the whites so that he can get better
            education. She also takes different kinds of <br>jobs to make ends meet and provide for the needs of Trevor.
            All
            these measures <br>ensure that Trevor gets a good upbringing. It also molds him into being able to
            <br>interact
            well with diverse people. She allows Trevor to explore things she never did <br>and most blacks were not
            allowed
            to.

      <div class="identity">
        <div class="identity-paragraph">
          <p>Trevor’s existence in the first place is a crime since it was not allowed for people to marry from <br>
            different races.Under apartheid regime Trevor is classified as coloured a category that set him <br> apart
            from
            his black Mother Patricia and his white father Robert.
            This identity dictates where <br>Trevor can live with his associates and how the people view him.For <br>
            instance when Patricia take Trevor to stay with his grandmother so that he can be safe,while he <br> is the
            grandmothers place is detained to play with the childrens around him because if the police <br> could spot
            it
            could be a case hence this affected Trevor which made him to feel discriminated <br> and also he could not
            walk
            with his mother openly.
            <br> <br> Despite the limitations of the assigned identity,Trevor put more effort into defining himself on
            his
            <br> own terms. His mother took a huge role to teach him how to fight the societal limitation to define <br>
            his
            own path of being independent and emphasis on faith. He used his adaptability and honour <br> to navigate
            different social groups since Trevor could even talk different languages that is <br> English,Xhosa and
            Africaners; this was a strength that helped him to manoeuvre among the <br> groups interactively while
            breaking
            the boundaries of race and culture.
            <br> Trevor’s journey is one of self-improvement as he continues to learn to restore the identity<br>
            assigned
            to him and the identity he chooses to become and he also comprehends the strength <br> and determination to
            maintain and express their unique identity even when faced with social and <br> cultural pressure to adapt.

          <p>Petricia reflects the concept of family as a shield by protecting her son,Travour, from the <br>dangers of
            apartheid while also building a strong foundation of character in him. <br>She bends rules, challenges
            social
            norms, and makes bold, often risky choices to <br>ensure his safety, survival, and long term success. <br>
            <br>

            Growing up as a mixed race child during apartheid in South Africa was illegal from the <br>start. Yet
            Patrcia
            knowingly risked her safety by having Travour with a white man.<br> Despite the danger, she never let
            society
            define him. She would often tell him, <br>“You are not your environment,” encouraging him to see beyond the
            limitations <br>imposed by race and poverty. <br> <br>

            Though she was strict and taught lessons the hard way, Patricia pushed Travor to <br>dream bigger. She
            encouraged him to read, speak fluent English, attend multiracial <br>schools, and visit places where he
            technically wasn’t allowed.She disciplined him <br>firmly, not out of cruelty, but to teach him
            responsibility
            and help him understand the <br>consequences of his actions. All of this was her way of preparing him to be
            strong <br>and independent, ready to face the world when she no longer could protect him <br>directly.<br>
            <br>

            This reflects what many families around the world do every day. Shielding their children <br>through both
            physical and emotional sacrifice. Like Patrcia, our parents often go <br>above and beyond to give us the
            life
            they never had. They wake up early to cook <br>for us, do our hair, walk long distances to take us to
            school,
            and work hard jobs to <br>make sure we survive. Even if they aren’t educated themselves, they value learning
            <br>and do everything possible to ensure we get a better education. They also prepare <br>us to handle
            life’s
            unpredictable challenges.
